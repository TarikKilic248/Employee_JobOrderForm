Job Order Creation Form

This project is designed to digitize and automate the job order creation process in a factory setting. Traditionally, job orders were manually filled out on paper, leading to inefficiencies and potential errors. This project replaces the manual process with a digital system, ensuring faster, more accurate job order management.

Key Features:

* Personnel Information and Job Order Creation:
  - Form for employees to enter their personal details, job description, start and end times.
  - Automatically records the creation time of the job order.
    
* Approval Form:
  - Separate form for supervisors or managers to review and approve job orders.
  - Includes fields for approval status, approval date, and comments.

* Material Unit Pricing:
  - Form for managers to enter unit prices of materials in euros per kilogram.
  - Ensures accurate cost calculations for production planning.

* Estimated Material Requirements:
  - Allows users to input estimated material quantities and units for a job.
  - Calculates total estimated costs based on unit prices.

* Actual Material Usage:
  - Records the actual materials used and time taken once the job is completed.
  - Compares estimated and actual usage to analyze discrepancies.

* Final Review and Reporting:
  - Compares estimated and actual data to provide a final report.
  - Includes calculations for cost and time differences, enabling better planning and resource allocation.

* Technologies Used:
  - SQL Server: For database management.
  - C# and .NET Framework: For creating the Windows Forms application.
  - Visual Studio: As the integrated development environment (IDE).

This project enhances the efficiency and accuracy of job order management in a manufacturing environment, leveraging digital forms and automated data processing. It provides a robust solution for tracking, approving, and reporting job orders, ultimately contributing to improved operational workflow.
